âœ… Task 1: Research and write a 1-page summary on:

Cybersecurity domains (explain at least 5)
Two real-world cyberattacks (How they happened & their impact).
âœ… Task 2: Create a Mind Map of Cybersecurity Domains (use any tool like Canva, Figma, or hand-drawn).



Answer:
Cybersecurity domains are the specific fields to protect specific area such as network, personal details, bank details, cloud data and application data.
Some cybersecurity domains are-
1.network security- IN this field we protect network from cyber attacks from unauthorized access from hackers.
2.offensive security- in this field we attack on our server, network, application, and all system to fiind vunerabilitis before real hackers attack.
3.cloud security- in this field we protect cloud data i.e. which is uploaded on the network or say internet from cyber attacks.
4.webapplication security-in this we protect web applications from hackers to protect credential data loss and leak of our users as well as company.
5.defensive security - in this field we defends against attacks by creating firewalls.
6.forensic and incident response team- in this field we investigate and respond to security incidents and cyberattacks.

Real world cyberattacks--
1.WannaCry Ransomware attack in 2017 on windows. The WannaCry ransomware attack spread globally in May 2017, targeting Windows computers using a security vulnerability in Microsoft SMB (Server Message Block) protocol.

The ransomware was based on an exploit called EternalBlue, originally developed by the NSA (National Security Agency) but later leaked by a hacker group called Shadow Brokers.
Once infected, the ransomware encrypted usersâ€™ files and demanded a ransom payment in Bitcoin to unlock them.
Impact:
More than 200,000 computers in 150+ countries were infected.
Hospitals, banks, and businesses were severely affected.
The UKâ€™s National Health Service (NHS) had to cancel thousands of medical appointments.
The estimated financial loss was $4 billion worldwide.
Microsoft released an emergency patch, and security experts created a "kill switch" to stop further infections.
ðŸ“Œ Key Lesson: Always keep software updated and apply security patches to prevent attacks.



2.Equifax data breach in 2017.
Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies, suffered a massive data breach in July 2017 due to a vulnerability in Apache Struts, a web application framework.

Hackers exploited an unpatched security flaw, allowing them to access Equifaxâ€™s servers.
The breach went undetected for 76 days, during which hackers stole sensitive personal information.
ðŸ”¹ Impact:
147 million peopleâ€™s data was exposed, including names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, and credit card details.
Equifax faced $700 million in fines and lawsuits.
Millions of Americans faced identity theft risks and fraud.
The companyâ€™s reputation was severely damaged.
ðŸ“Œ Key Lesson: Regular security audits and prompt patching of vulnerabilities are crucial for data protection.
